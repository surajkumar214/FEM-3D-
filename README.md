# FEM-3D

                              IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL STIFFNESS MATRIX FOR 3D BODY IN C
                              
The local stiffness matrix for FEM has been written in C for 3D bodies. The primary building of the body is Tetrahedrons. When a force is subjected to a body divided into tetrahedrons, each vertex undergoes certain displacement in 3 dimensions. Here we calculate a local stiffness matrix which can be assembled to calculate the global stiffness matrix. The global stiffness matrix is, in turn, used to calculate the displacement of each vertex.
